This archive contains script that installs dse-spark-dependencies in your local maven repository.

# Prerequisites

- Apache Maven(tm) installed
- Spark Application's build file must use local maven repository (SparkBuildExamples already do that)
- Get the dependancies from DataStax Wiki

# Execution

Run following command to install EAP dse-spark-dependencies in your local maven repository:

```
./install.sh
```

# Build Spark Application

Change dse-spark-dependencies version to 6.0.0-eapX, where X is your EAP version. For example, for maven and 6.0.0-eap1 the dependency should look like:

```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.datastax.dse</groupId>
      <artifactId>dse-spark-dependencies</artifactId>
      <version>6.0.0-eap1</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
```

SparkBuildExamples contains properties that hold dse-spark-dependencies, for example for maven:

```
<dse.version>6.0.0-eap1</dse.version>
```
